Metric,Description
Percentage of Stocks Overfished,"Percentage of commercial stocks within the management authority's jurisdiction that are considered to be overfished, to be experiencing overfishing, or whose stock status is generally unknown. (Degree of overfishing and current trend are the next questions.) Single stock fisheries will be scored 1 or 5."
Degree of Overfishing- Stock Status,Current status of stock. For multispecies fisheries do a value-weighted average of the top three stocks. Two alternate scoring systems are offered. The first is for fisheries where stock levels are not known with any precision. The second is for fisheries where scientific stock assessments are being conducted and measures of B (biomass level) and BMSY (biomass level required to obtain maximum sustainable yield) are available.
"Stock Declining, Stable or Rebuilding - Stock Dynamics","Extent to which current effort levels affect stock status. For multispecies fisheries do a value-weighted average of the top three stocks. This measure is scored by taking the fishery’s score in the previous question and then adding or subtracting points depending on whether the fishery is rebuilding or declining. The maximum score for this measure is a 5 and the minimum score is a 1. If the fishery scored a 5 in the previous question then the score here is automatically a 5. If the fishery scored less than 5 in the previous measure, then take the fishery’s score from the previous measure and add or subtract as noted."
Regulatory Mortality,"Ratio of estimated regulatory mortality to actual landings of the target species. Regulatory mortality is defined as fish loss that is induced by regulation, such as size restrictions."
Selectivity,"Percentage of total catch that is made up of non-target species. Note that non-target species are distinct from multispecies fisheries in that the catch of non-target species does not increase the value of fishing, or imposes costs on the target fishery."
"Illegal, Unregulated or Unreported Landings","Proportion of landings from the managed stock using illegal gear, area, methods, etc., or that goes unreported or falls outside of the regulatory structure. See manual for how to deal with incursion from the recreational sector."
Status of Critical Habitat,"Portion of critical habitat that is damaged or dysfunctional. Critical habitat is defined as that playing a significant role in the life cycle of the fish.  Portion damaged is based on area, and from all sources of damage including fishing damage, pollution and development. "
Discard Mortality,"Proportion of catch that suffer post-release mortality. In the absence of specific discards records, best guess may be calculated based on post-release mortality rates from similar fishing gears and expert judgment.   "
Spatial mixing between open areas to fishing and closed areas,"The proportion of spatial mixing between areas open to fishing and closed areas. The score for this question should reflect the average annual movement rates of target species in and out of an existing spatial closure. If no spatial closures exist, the question should be scored as 5."
Spatial mixing expected between open areas to fishing and closed areas,"The proportion of spatial mixing that is expected between areas open to fishing and closed areas. The score for this question should reflect the average annual movement rates of target species in and out of an expected spatial closure. If no spatial closures are planned, the question should be scored as 5."
Discarded Catch,"Proportion of catch that is unused and discarded at sea. In the absence of specific discards records, best guess may be calculated based on comparisons of discards rates from similar fishing gears and expert judgment.   "
Catch Reporting,"Proportion of the catch that is not reported, misreported or over-reported to relevant authorities. Unreported fishing is not necessarily illegal or unregulated, though it can be either. "
Proportionality between the index of relative abundance (CPUE) and the real biomass ,"Measure of proportionality between trends in CPUE and biomass. It may be calculated based on the description of non-linear relationships: 1) Hyperdepletion occurs when CPUE remains high despite population abundance declines. For example, this relationship is expected to occur in species with cryptic habits (e.g. lobster, octopus) in which part of the stock is not reachable by fishing methods. 2) A hyperstable relationship is thought to occur when CPUE is high and population abundance declines. For example, when ?shers target the centre of pelagic aggregations, so CPUE remains stable despite the population contracting and declining."
Proportion of Harvest with a 3rd Party Certification ,"The proportion of harvest (quantity) harvested under one of the recognized third party programs that certify ecological sustainability, such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification. See manual for how to deal with other certification or fishery improvement programs."
Landings Level ,"Average annual harvest over the last three years.  Note that this measure refers to MSY but there are many fisheries where the lack of stock assessments and reliable data mean that these estimates are unattainable. In such fisheries, score is based on discerning the goal of management/harvesters when deciding how much to land."
Excess Capacity,"In the absence of a fishery-specific measure of overfishing, use estimated standardized vessel-days required to catch the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) compared to the number of standardized vessel-days available.  Days are considered not to be restricted by trip limits."
Season Length,"Ratio of number of days on which fishing occurs to the number of days the species is available in economically feasible quantities.  This is primarily a measure of the extent of derby (including short regulatory seasons to limit total effort), not lack of biological availability or closures to prevent within-season growth overfishing."
Historical Variability of Fishing Effort,"Percentage of change in the inter-annual variability in fishing effort throughout the history of the fishery. This information can be obtained by calculating the average inter-annual variability of effort units between years (e.g. number of vessels per year, number of fishing trips per year, effective fishing time per year, etc.)."
Historical Changes in Fishing Efficiency,"Percentage of change in fishing efficiency as a result of improvements in fishing gears and technology (e.g. better nets, echo-sounders, radio buoys, GPS, changes in fleet dynamics and fishers´ behavior). Two alternative scoring systems are offering. The first is for fisheries where historical variability in catchability is not known with any precision but observations on improvements in fishing gears and technology exist. The second is for fisheries where historical trends in catchability are available and can be correlated to improvements in fishing gears and technology."
Spatial closures planned for the future,"Proportion of spatial closure that could be introduced in the future with respect to the total area intended for fishing. Points to be assigned based on progressive policies, strategies, and current governmental proposals to enlarge marine protected areas."
Potential management regulations,"Management regulations that could be feasibly implemented in the future. The score is meant to measure potential policies, strategies and decisions concerning fisheries management."
Harvest Safety,"Number of harvester (captain or crew) on-the-job deaths, per thousand person fishing season.  We consider there to be one season per year, but do not annualize mortality if the fishing season is less than a year."
Ratio of Asset Value to Gross Earnings,"Extent to which fishery wealth is accumulated in access capital (e.g., quota, permits or vessels). Ratio of average price of capital and licenses required to access the fishery over the last five years to the average annual gross earnings for a similarly scaled access right in the same period.  Typically a 1 if vessels or quota not limited by regulation. Same business or same family sales are excluded, where they can be identified. See 'Historical Data' tab."
Total Revenue Compared to Historic High,The indicator is the ratio of total real revenue (in local currency) to the average of the three highest total real revenues in the past 10 years. Adjust by local CPI if inflation was significant. See 'Historical Data' Tab.
"Asset (Permit, Quota, etc...) Value Compared to Historic High","The indicator is the ratio of the current value of the harvest asset (permit, quota, vessel, etc...) to the average of the three highest asset values in the past 10 years.  Adjust by local CPI if inflation was significant.  Typically 1 if wealth is not accumulating in vessels, permits or quota. See 'Historical Data' tab."
Borrowing Rate Compared to Risk-free Rate,"Average ratio between the interest rate on loans made to harvesters in the industry to risk-free rates over the last three years.  If businesses can access international credit markets, then the international risk free rate (US 10 year Treasury Bill) is an appropriate comparison; otherwise, use local risk free rate. See 'Historical Data' tab."
Source of Capital ,"Points to be assigned based on the category of lenders or investors that are most typically used by harvesters in the fishery.  Second scoring method offered if the supply chain (e.g., traders, processors, exporters) are the primary source of capital."
 Functionality of Harvest Capital,"Average age of the key durable harvesting capital unit (vessels, weirs).  Ages are not assigned to scores due to differences in expected useful life, but buildings and industrial vessels have expected life of roughly 20 years."

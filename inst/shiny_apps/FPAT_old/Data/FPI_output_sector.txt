FPI output scores measure the fishery's performance based on where wealth is accumulating in the fishery. Higher scores are better, reflecting that more wealth is being generated in the stock resource, among fishermen and the harvest sector, or in the processing sector.

This graph is used to identify the dimensions where the fishery is performing well, and to target dimensions for improvement. Different fisheries may have different, locally identified performance priorities.

As a general rule, scoring levels have been chosen so that scores below 3 reflect the need for improvement. The fishery may also be compared to benchmark scores for select categories of fisheries, average scores for those fisheries in the FPI database.
